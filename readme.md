# JamesSharp

This language is a joke and was made in less than 200 lines of Python. (Being rewritten in JavaScript)

## About
JamesSharp is an interpreted language, it runs through a code file, forms a code stack from each line, and adds it all to a compiled file. When a compiled file is run, it is decoded and run with Python.
